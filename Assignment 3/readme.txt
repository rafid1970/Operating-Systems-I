Assignment 3 - smallsh

Throughout the assignment, I found the many online resources on how to implement
a shell in C to be pretty helpful when I was stuck. Here are some of the URLs that
gave me a good idea on how to do some things:

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4788374/writing-a-basic-shell
http://cboard.cprogramming.com/c-programming/141949-writing-c-shell.html
http://brennan.io/2015/01/16/write-a-shell-in-c/
http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Implementing-a-Shell.html

So the entire assignment is all in one big file, to run the program, run the following command to compile:

gcc -o smallsh smallsh.c

And to start the shell, run the following command,

./smallsh

That should be it, enjoy!
